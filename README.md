# Clustering_the_City-Vancouver

This repo is for my final project for the Applied Data Science Capstone offered by IMB/Coursera.

The project uses web-scraping and Foursquare API calls to build a data set about Vancouver, British Columbia (CA).

Clustering is used to compare neighborhoods for use in evaluating potential locations for restaurants.
